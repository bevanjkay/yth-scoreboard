# yth-scoreboard

This scoreboard was designed to be used by Youth Ministries who do not have access to presentation software to run a scoreboard during games/tribal wars.

It uses vanilla JS, making use of the Local Storage API to store the data and then display it in a second browser window.

### How to Use

####Initial Creation

- Type in team names
- Choose team colors (by default will be red and blue)
- Click "create or refresh scoreboard"
- Move newly created window / tab to second screen (TV or projector)

####Updating Scores
Note: Due to a security limitation, if running files locally on Google Chrome you will be required to use the "create or refresh scoreboard" buttton to update score.
If running from a hosted website, then this limitation can be ignored.

Method 1) Type in a new score, and click "save" to update immediately, or "create or refresh scoreboard" to refresh with animation.
Method 2) Use the incrementation buttons (+1 / -1) next to the score. Scores will be updated automatically.
